# Contributing

This list depends on the contributions of the community to keep it complete and update-to-date. The goal is to have mostly projects that are maintained and useful to the community.

## How?

The easiest way to contribute a change is to go to https://github.com/CadQuery/awesome-cadquery/blob/main/README.md and click on the "pen" icon in the upper right corner. Make the changes to the file and follow the `Propose changes` instructions at the bottom to create a pull request.

If you want to add an entry to the `README.md` please consider these things:

- Is the entry valuable to people trying to get things done in CadQuery?
    - For example: make sure that the project is not an abandoned experiment before adding it.
- If you want to add something, please use the template `[ACCOUNT/REPO](https://github.com/ACCOUNT/REPO) - DESCRIPTION`
    * If the project has a CI build, please add the build badge. Put the image after the description, separated by a space. Please make sure to add the branch information to the image:
        * Example for Travis: `[![build badge](https://api.travis-ci.com/XXX/CRATE.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.org/github/XXX/CRATE)`
        * For Github actions please see [adding-a-workflow-status-badge](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/adding-a-workflow-status-badge)
- Please pay attention to the alphabetical ordering.

## Removing projects

The maintainers of this repository reserve the right to remove projects that seem to be abandoned and/or broken. However, if enough community members use the project, it may just be marked as needing a maintainer and kept on the list. In most cases efforts will be made to not remove projects unless they are outright broken or pronounced deprecated by another project or by its author.
